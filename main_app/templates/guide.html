Users can assign categories to their items, such as dairy, produce, or household essentials, which helps streamline both the shopping and planning process. Items can be viewed and sorted by category, providing a structured and logical overview of the list. This categorization reduces the time spent searching for specific items and allows users to group similar products together, improving the overall shopping experience.
